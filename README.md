THIS IS A SINGLE PLAYER OFFLINE GAMING APP, WHICH INCLUDES 3 SMALL GAMES IN IT. THIS PROJECT IS CREATED USING PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND KIVY LIBRARY. 
FIRST GAME IS 'BOLLYWOOD' WHICH IS THE ONLINE VERSION OF THE GAME WE ALL HAVE PLAYED IN OUR SCHOOL DAYS
SECOND GAME IS 'STONE PAPER SCISSOR' WHICH WE PLAY AGINST THE COMPUTER AGAIN 
AND THE THIRD AND LAST GAME IS ' THE TAP COUNTER' WHERE WE ARE GIVEN 10 SECONDS AND YOU HAVE TO CLICK AS MANY TIMES AS POSSIBLE TO WIN , IN THE END HIGH SCORE WILL BE PRINTED . THIS IS A VERY COMPETITIVE GAME
I SEEK TO ADD MORE GAMES IN IT IN FUTURE AND APPRECIATE IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO ADD THEIR CONTRIBUTION IN THIS GAME.
APART FROM ADDING GAMES I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO IMPROVE COLOR AND ADD DESIGNS AND SOUND IN THIS GAME IN FUTURE WITH IMPROVEMENT IN MY SKILLS
